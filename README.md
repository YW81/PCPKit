- mc_lin (Linearised ADM)
- mc_ialm (Inexact ALM)
- mc_relax_lin (Relaxed Linearised Gradient Descent)
- mc_relax_lin_ext (Relaxed Linearised Extended GD)
- mc_relax_lin_acc (Relaxed Linearised Accelerated GD)

Selective PCP:
- sel_pcp (Linearised ADM)

See the docs, demo and functions themselves for more details.
